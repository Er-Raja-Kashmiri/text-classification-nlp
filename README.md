# Text Classification using NLP
# Objective
Build a text classification model using NLP to classify customer reviews / SMS messages as Positive vs Negative or Spam vs Non‑Spam.
# Tools & Technologies
Python, Jupyter NotebookPandas, NumPyscikit-learnNLP tools (tokenization, stopword removal, TF‑IDF)
# Key Steps
Loaded and cleaned raw text data, removed duplicates and handled missing values.Performed text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords and tokenization).
Converted text to numerical features using Bag‑of‑Words / TF‑IDF.Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) and compared accuracy and other metrics.
# Results
Achieved good classification performance for identifying positive/negative reviews or spam/non‑spam messages.
Demonstrated how NLP and machine learning can automate sentiment or spam detection for real applications.
# How to Run
Clone this repository.Place the dataset in the data/ folder (update path in notebook if needed).
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.Open notebooks/text_classification_nlp.ipynb and run the cells.
